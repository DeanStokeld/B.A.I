                <p>
                    The header div (highlighted in <span id="highlight-yellow">&nbsp;yellow&nbsp;</span>) contains the tityle of the website. It uses the
                    &lt;h1&gt; tag and it has the class 'header' which is called as .header in websystems.css file.
                </p><br><br>

            </h4>
                <p>
                    The navigation bar div (highlighted in <span id="highlight-red">&nbsp;red&nbsp;</span>) contains the navigation bar of the website, which is visible on all pages. 
                    It uses the &lt;a&gt; tag (which is used to create hyperlinks) and it has the class 'nav' which is called as .nav in the websystems.css file.
                    The navigation bar is a large block of hyperlinks to the pages 'Home' (index.html), Past (past.html), Future (future.html) and Comments (comments.html).<br><br><br>

                    The main div (highlighted in <span id="highlight-blue">&nbsp;blue&nbsp;</span>, which is also referred to as 'body') is where all of the information of the selected page is contained. This area contains several components such as 
                    header tags (&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt; & &lt;h4&gt;), paragraph tags (&lt;p&gt;), image tags (&lt;img&gt;)and table tags (&lt;table&gt;) in the HTML code to assist 
                    in presenting several different types of information to the user.<br><br>On pages 'Past' and 'Comments' (this page), I have inserted a small icon on the bottom right with the text 'Back to top', 
                    once clicked this allows the user to immediately jump to the top of the page instead of having to scroll all the way back up.<br><br><br>

                4. Footer
            </h4>
                <p>
                    The footer div (highlighted in <span id="highlight-green">&nbsp;green&nbsp;</span>) is located at the bottom of the screen and provides some information regarding copyright information, contact information, links to other pages or resources, and other information.
                    In the footer on this page I have copyright information and other general information such as the Subject name of this course and the univerisyt.<br><br>Towards the right side of the footer I have small hyperlinks separated 
                    by a vertical bar that links to the other pages of the website.

                Aesthetics
            </h2>
                <p>
                    The approach of this website is to take a minimalistic approach to display information in a simplistic manner.
                    This approach encourages accessability which allows readability of the webpage. There are webpages that do not take this approach, such as <a href="http://www2.pnwx.com/">Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc</a> and <a href="https://www.lingscars.com/">Ling's Cars</a>.<br><br>
                </p>
        <div>
            <figure class = "image-container">
                <img class = "Grayscale" src="images/grayscale.png" alt="Grayscale Pallet">
            <figcaption class="image-caption">Grayscale Palette</figcaption>

                Colour
            </h3>
        </div>
            
                <p>
                    The colours used in this webpage is black, white and gray. I chose this grayscale colour palette to prevent any affect on the readability of the webpage. This also enables people with colour-blindness to browse the website without any difficulty. However, I couldn't avoid having colour in some images.
                </p><br>
            <h3>
                Font
            </h3>
                <p>
                    The font chosen for this website is the font family of Arial, Helvetica and sans-serif. A font family is a list of fonts that the webpage will prioritise from left to right until it finds a font that is available to be used.
                </p><br>
            <h3>
                Interactivity
            </h3>
                <p>
                    There are two parts of this webpage that incorporates some interactivity. The first being the navigation bar, using the :hover and :active tags in CSS, I was able to change the background colour and font colour of the navigation bar once hovered over with a mouse and/or clicked (visited).<br>
                    Another area of interactivity is the button on the bottom right of your screen now, the 'Back to Top' brings the user to the top of the webpage once clicked.
                </p><br>
            </div>
            <div>
            <h2>
                Accessibility

            </div>
                <div>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">The W3C Web Accessibility Initiate</a> has outlined guidelines for how to successfully achieve website accessibility. They believe accessibility is essential for every website as without it you cannot create a high quality websites.
                    They believe that website accessability, specifically the ability to access information, as a basic human right. This has also been outlined by the UN as well, which you can read <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/article-9-accessibility.html">here</a> if you like.<br>
                    For the reasons listed above, I have considered the following aspects of this website:
                    <figure class = "image-container">
                        <img class = "Mobile" src="images/Mobile.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the webpage using a mobile phone">

                    </figure>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Font Sizing
                            <ul>
                                <li>The font sizing on this webpage is relative to how much the user is zoomed in. For example, if the user zooms in the font size will increase.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li><br>
                        <li>Screen Readers
                            <ul>
                                <li>Screen readers are unable to relay information from an image to the user, however using the 'alt' tag in the &lt;img&gt; tag I am able to described the image which a screen reader will be able to read and relay that information to the user.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li><br>
                        <li>Font Type
                            <ul>
                                <li>The font selected for this website set as a family. As described in Aesthetics, the font family chosen contains the following fonts: Arial, Helvetica and sans-serif. The webpage will prioritise the fonts from left to right until an available font is found. These font is very legible and will present the users the information without difficulty.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li><br>
                        <li>W3C Valiator Checker
                            <ul>
                                <li>I ran all of my HTML code through the The W3C Markup Validation Service and received no errors or warnings. I also ran my CSS through The W3c CSS Valiation Service and recieved zero errors or warnings.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li><br>
                        <li>Mobile Users
                            <ul>
                                <li>Mobile users were also considered while developing this website. With this in mind, I included a media query that targets devices with a maximum width of 1000 pixels and 500 pixels and the webpage will automatically adjust for resolutions at or below this. For example:
                                    <ul><br>
                                        <li>The title's size reduces based on the screen size and the image sizes scale down to accomodate for the smaller screen.</li>
                                        <li>The navigation bar is now at the top of the page and the position is fixed, meaning as you scroll down the nivation bar will stay at the top of your mobile screen, similar to how the 'Back to top' button works.</li>
                                        <li>I removed the 'Back to Top' button as users may accidently tap this button which would be rather distruptive.</li>
                                        <li>I removed the hyperlinks in the footer to switch between pages as they seemed to not resize properly in the footer which caused some undesirable effects.</li>
                                        <li>Additionall, for devices that have a screen size smaller than 500 pixels, the navigation bar will now stack on top of itself. I did this because the words become very squished on a small screen while keeping the font size legible.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </div>
