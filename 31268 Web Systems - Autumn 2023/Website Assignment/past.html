            <h2>General Experience with Computers</h2>
            <p>
                At the moment I do not have any professional experience with computers however 
                I did grow up with computers at my disposal which has enabled me to grow my basic 
                computer skills and understanding of computers.<br><br>
                For example, I've troubleshooted many technical issues I've come across and found appropriate soltuions, as well as providing some technical support to friends and family.
            </p>
            <h2>Computing Education</h2>
            <p>
                During High School in Year 11 and 12 I completed "Information Processes and Technology" (IPT) as one
                of my subjects during my HSC.<br><br>
                I have also completed a 6-month Data Science and Innovation course at UTS through the Institute of Data last year, this covered many topics including, but not limited to:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>SQL</li>
                    <li>Data cleaning & visualisation</li>
                    <li>Developing machine learning models (classification/regression)</li>
                    <li>Deep learning (FFNNs, RNNs & CNNs)</li>
                    <li>Reinforcement learning</li>
                    <li>Cloud Computing</li>
                    <li>Deploying ML models</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                In additon to the list above, I was also tasked to develop machine learning model to detect pneumonia in 5,216 chest x-rays images which yielded a
                94.44% accuracy and took 12 hours to train.<br><br>
                I first had to clean the data then analyse using python libraries, such as NumPY, Matploblib and Pandas. I then performed data pre-processing & data augmentation on the 
                data followed by training different models using the Python package 'TensorFlow' at various epochs and batch sizes with a ResNet50V2 model 
                performing with the highest accuracy of 94.44%.<br><br>

                Here are examples of the type of images I was working with:
