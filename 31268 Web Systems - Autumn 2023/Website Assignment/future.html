            <h2>Career Goals</h2>
            <p>
                In the future I would hope to start a career in Data Science field, whether that's Data Analytics, Data Engineering or Data Science. However I have a keen interest in Machine Learning and A.I. so a position in Data Science would be ideal.<br><br> I have these aspirations because I very much enjoy working with data and building ML models.<br><br>
            </p>
            <h2>
                Skill Goals
            </h2>
            <p>
                At the moment I have foundational skills in Python and some of its Data Science-related libraries, such as the ones listed in the <a href="past.html">Past page</a> and more.<br><br>
                So an aspiration of mine would be to increase my knowledge and skills in Python as well as becoming more familiar with its libraries. In addition to this, I aim to also learn the programming language R, as I've heard this is still used in the field however I believe Data Scientists are slowly transitioning away from R and replacing it with Python.
